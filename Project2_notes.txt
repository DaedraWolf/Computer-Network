Project 2: List to-do / Improve Project 1:
1. Neighborhood Discovery:
2. Link-state Flooding, modify to distribute link state info
3. Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm) --> In order to do Routing Table
4. Forwarding: Now direct forwarding based on routing table


Known issues:
- Flooding doesnt detect neighbor info to optimize packet transmission. Packages are broadcast rather than sent only to known neighbors
Improve:
1. Link-state flood alg.
========================================

Linking both modules of NeighborhoodDiscovery and Flooding:

1. Flooding.nc - Updating neighbors

command void updateNeighborList();

2. FloodingP.nc - For using NeighborDiscovery

module {

uses interface neighborDiscovery;
}

uint32_t* neighbors = call NeighborDiscovery.getNeighbors();
uint16_t numNeighbors = call NeighborDiscovery.getNeighborCount();

^^--- Not used yet however,

Dijkstra's algorithm:
N - {set of nodes in grapth [i,j]} // denotes (weight)
